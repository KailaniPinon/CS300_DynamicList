/* Nothing to show here. Mark assignment as 0 if necessary.
 *
 * Makefile and header file attempted, but truthfully, much
 * of my time was spent attempting to fix list and priority queue.
 *
 * And even with attempts to update and prepare the list and
 * priority queue ADTs for queue and airport, I still ran into
 * plenty of Valgrind and performance (test file) errors.

 *
 * I'm very much aware that I've yet to perform well on any of
 * the assignments. That isn't to say I didn't try, but I just
 * want to apologize if I took up additional time and energy
 * towards grading when I have yet to meet the average standards.
 *
 * I'll try to learn what I can during the next assignment, but
 * truthfully I'm very much bracing myself for if (or likely when)
 * I fail this course.
 *
 * I'm not angry per se, but rather just super disappointed in myself.
 * But seeing as we have 3 more weeks, I'll do what I can.
